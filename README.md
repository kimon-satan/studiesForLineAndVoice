#### More Ideas

- blending fixed shapes and sine waves (create different blending functions)
- extend progression by adding sine waves together + noise
- symmetries
- linear movement from one shape to another
- try more manipulations of control points on beziers

#### Presentation ideas

- make a series of studies interpreting the same breath recording.
- a single study showing a series of interpretations of breath
- a series of line studies just with sine and noise (fixed states or small progressions) / try to capture different characters that would have sound implications
